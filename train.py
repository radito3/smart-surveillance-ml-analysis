# create all models, model variations with different neurons per layer, different number of layers, etc.
# download criminal activity datasets
# find and download surveillance footage of normal behaviour
# split 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test
# create processes for each model
# train 100 epochs, check accuracy, repeat training until the difference in accuracy between validation iterations
#    is less than a threshold
